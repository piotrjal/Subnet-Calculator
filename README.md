# Subnet Calculator

A project that I made for Computer Networks in the second year of my studies.


After entering the ip address and shortened subnet mask (e.g 192.168.1.1/24), it calculates:
- network address,
- network class,
- full subnet mask,
- broadcast address,
- first host address,
- last host address,
- maximum number of hosts.

The results are given in decimal and binary systems
